JmonkeyEngine experiment

Visual process viewer or something like that.

I really wanted to create something based on what we could see in one of the Avengers Age of Ultron movie: 
Remember  the Holographic representation of Jarvis? The big orange sphere?

Well...

I created a program that can be attached to any PID and let you visualize in 3D the latest stack trace.
A sphere is an individual method....and if the sphere is bigger it means that the method is called more frequently.

So with this in mind you can potentially see what is going on inside a program....


Sorry but this time it only works with Windows.

I don't have much time to play with it, but hopefully someone can improve this and make it better.

You need to run this with a PID number as an argument to attach it to that PID.
